# Simulating a 3D Pirate Cove with Custom Shaders
An implementation of advanced graphical shaders by utilising the OpenGL shading language GLSL and using the RenderMonkey Toolsuite.
With this I was able to create a pirate treasure cove as demonstrated in Figure 1.0 below. In this document, I will break down every effect I used and I will explain how I used variables and mathematical techniques to solve graphical problems.
